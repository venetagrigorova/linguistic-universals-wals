## Rules

We analyzed the following rules in this project.


| ID # | Rule |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| 3 | Languages with dominant VSO order are always prepositional. |
| 4 | With overwhelmingly more than chance frequency, languages with normal SOV order are postpositional. |
| 5 | If a language has dominant SOV order and the genitive follows the governing noun, then the adjective likewise follows the noun. |
| 6 | All languages with dominant VSO order have the adjective after the noun. |
| 16 | If a language has dominant order VSO in declarative sentences, it always puts prepositions before the noun. |
| 17 | With overwhelmingly more than chance frequency, languages with dominant order SOV are postpositional. |
| 18 | When the descriptive adjective precedes the noun, the demonstrative and the numeral likewise precede. |
| 19 | When the descriptive adjective follows the noun, the demonstrative and the numeral likewise follow. |
| 20 | When any or all of the modifiers precede the noun, the genitive almost always precedes. |
| 21 | When any or all of the modifiers follow the noun, the genitive almost always follows. |
| 22 | If in a language the relative clause precedes the noun, the language is postpositional; if it follows, the language is prepositional. |
| 23 | If in a language the verb precedes the object, the adjective likewise precedes the noun. |
| 24 | If in a language the verb follows the object, the adjective likewise follows the noun. |
