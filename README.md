# Milestone 1 – Testing Linguistic Universals with WALS

### why we chose these features
we picked features from WALS that describe how words and phrases are ordered:

| WALS code | Feature name | why it matters |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **81A** | order of subject, object and verb | shows the main clause order (SVO, SOV, etc.) |
| **85A** | order of adposition and noun phrase | lets us test the rule “VO → prepositions; OV → postpositions” |
| **86A** | order of genitive and noun | often aligns with verb–object order |
| **87A** | order of adjective and noun | helps test whether modifiers follow the same pattern |
| **88A** | order of demonstrative and noun | another element of noun phrase order |
| **90A** | order of relative clause and noun | tests whether clause modifiers follow the same direction trend |
