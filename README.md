# Milestone 1 – Testing Linguistic Universals with WALS

### why we chose these features
we picked features from WALS that describe how words and phrases are ordered:

| WALS code | feature name | why it matters |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **81A** | order of subject, object and verb | tells us the basic sentence order (like SVO or SOV) |
| **85A** | order of adposition and noun phrase | helps check if languages with verbs before objects use prepositions, and those with verbs after objects use postpositions |
| **86A** | order of genitive and noun | shows how words like “my” or “John’s” appear with nouns, often linked to sentence order |
| **87A** | order of adjective and noun | tells us if adjectives come before or after the noun (like “big house” vs “house big”) |
| **88A** | order of demonstrative and noun | shows where words like “this” or “that” appear in relation to the noun |
| **90A** | order of relative clause and noun | shows if extra information about a noun (“the man **who came**”) comes before or after it |
